# Affordable Data Summarizer

This demo app was made to support a post on my Affordable Data Substack. Check out the post for background.

There are a lot of example apps for summarizing text, and some of them use Streamlit like this one. But I didn't find any others that allowed the user to compare summaries from multiple AI providers.
